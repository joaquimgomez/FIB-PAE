## Development considerations

This project is just a prototype. For this reason we cannot guarantee a perfect functioning in all the possible situations.

For the front-end part it uses Vue.js, as well as, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

For the back-end it uses a Node.js based server, with a MySQL Database.

Given that we cannot ensure a online database forever, if you want to execute this project in a self environment, you should configure a proper database context.

Moreover, in order to use the Computer Vision Module, a correct configuration is mandatory. 
This one consist in a proper installation of OpenCV 4 library and the opencv4nodejs module (as you can see [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencv4nodejs)), in addition to a Google Cloud Platform (Vision API) credential.
